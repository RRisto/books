## Books

Obsidian notes about the books I've read.

To add books in Obsidian:
`ctrl+n` and `ctrl+p` and add new template `Book`. 

But you can use `python .\app\app.py` to run app and add book with cover.
You can list the book and edit them via browser.


I have made script to add a book from the Goodreads:

`create_book_from_goodreads("https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245986477-aju-vabadus")`
