### Puuduvad leheküljed
**Author:** Jüri Engelbrecht  
**Published:** 2025  
**Finished:** 2025-12  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Pages:** 234  

Tunnustatud teaduse populariseerija, akadeemik Jüri Engelbrecht lisab selles raamatus puuduvaid lehekülgi varem kirja pandud mõtetele, mis on ilmunud õige mitmes raamatus. Nende kaante vahelt leiab ka muljed, mis on elu jooksul hinge soojendanud, ja raamatud, mis on huvi pakkunud. Mis tehtud, saab sõnadeks, ja sõnadel on Tähendus.

Raamatule on kirjutanud saatesõna poetess Doris Kareva : „Veeta mõned tunnid haritud inimese seltsis, kes saab aru maailma probleemidest ja oskab tegutseda nii lokaalselt kui ka globaalselt, kes ise on innukas, aga ka valiv lugeja, kes toetab teadlasena ennekõike kvaliteeti ja noori inimesi ja kelle eruditsioon ja keelenõtkus võimaldab lugejal lustida ühtaegu mitmel olemise tasandil, on puhas luksus.“
